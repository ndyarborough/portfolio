            <p className='leftAlign topMarg botMarg'>I‚Äôm a recent college graduate (12/2023) with a BSCS with a concentration in Software
                Engineering, but I also have 7 years of coding experience. At 27, I‚Äôm a little older than most
                recent college grads, and honestly, more mature, experienced, and hardworking than most.
                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                I am looking to develop software for a company where I can make a difference, be a solid contributor,
                continue to gain experience and grow my skillset. I prefer working in a team environment, but
                most of my experience is as a solo practitioner.

                <br></br>
                <br></br>
                Either way, I‚Äôm ready to go to work. I&#39;m
                passionate about my work. I‚Äôm seeking a position as a Full-Stack Software Engineer. I am
                based in Raleigh, North Carolina. Read on to see and experience what I‚Äôm working on right
